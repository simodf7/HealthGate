# HealthGate

HealthGate is a microservices‑based integration platform for the e‑health domain. It aims to facilitate interoperability among heterogeneous health systems by embracing standards such as FHIR, enabling contextualized implementations, and supporting modular services for clinical data processing.

## Background & Motivation

Modern healthcare systems often suffer from fragmentation: disparate systems, incompatible interfaces, and different data formats. HealthGate addresses these challenges by providing:

- A microservices architecture for modular, scalable solutions  
- Use of the **FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)** standard to improve interoperability  
- Support for integrating domain-specific services (e.g. ECG analysis, risk scoring)  
- Flexibility to plug in new services in a decoupled way  

The design draws inspiration from academic work on a microservice integration platform for health (often referred to in literature as “HealthGate”) that demonstrated deployments of services like atrial fibrillation detection and Framingham risk scoring.

---

## Architecture Overview

HealthGate is composed of several core elements:

- **Gateway / API Layer**  
  A facade layer that exposes HTTP / REST interfaces (e.g. FHIR endpoints) and routes requests to the appropriate microservice.

- **Microservices**  
  Each microservice handles a specific domain logic (ECG processing, risk scoring, diagnostics).  
  They communicate via REST or messaging, and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

- **Data & Interoperability**  
  Internal data exchange and external API contracts use FHIR resources to ensure semantic compatibility.

- **Orchestration / Workflow**  
  Depending on the use case, the system can orchestrate multi-step workflows (e.g. collect data → analyze → score → respond).

- **Frontend / UI**  
  A user-facing application (web) to visualize data, trigger tasks, or monitor results.

---

## Features & Use Cases

- Integration of clinical data from various sources (e.g. EHR, sensors)  
- Standardized API interfaces based on FHIR  
- Deployment of health‑focused microservices (e.g. ECG analysis, risk estimation)  
- Modular extension: you can add new services without modifying core system  
- Support for orchestration of multi-step health workflows  

Example use cases implemented or envisioned in this repository include:

1. **Atrial Fibrillation Detection**  
   A microservice that processes ECG segments and detects episodes of atrial fibrillation.  

2. **Framingham Risk Score Computation**  
   A service that consumes patient clinical data and returns cardiovascular risk.  

3. **Prediction / Diagnostic Services**  
   Additional services (e.g. for diabetes prediction) can be plugged in.

A few notes:

- Each microservice typically has its own subfolder under `microservices/`.  
- The `frontend/` project interacts via APIs exposed by the gateway layer.  
- The `documentation/` folder contains design documents and API contracts to guide extension and development.

## Requirements & Dependencies

You’ll need:

- **Python** (version as per microservice requirements)  
- Web framework (e.g. Flask, FastAPI, Django — depending on implementation)  
- FHIR library / SDK (for resource parsing, serialization)  
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)  
- Node.js / frontend framework (for `frontend/`)  
- Other dependencies per microservice (e.g. ML libraries, signal processing, data science)  

Make sure to check each microservice’s `requirements.txt` or dependency file.

---

## Setup & Deployment

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/simodf7/HealthGate.git
   cd HealthGate
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables / settings**  
   Set up config such as service ports, database URIs, FHIR server endpoints.

3. **Build & run via Docker Compose**  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This brings up the gateway, microservices, and any supporting services (databases, message queues).

4. **Run services locally (optional)**  
   You may run individual microservices using their local development server (e.g. `uvicorn`, `flask run`, etc.), if you prefer not to use containers.

5. **Access the frontend / APIs**  
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (or port configured)  
   - Gateway / API endpoints: http://localhost:8000/fhir, or other paths

6. **Health checks & monitoring**  
   Each service should expose health endpoints (e.g. `/health`) to aid readiness and liveness checks.

## Usage Examples

### Example: Submit patient data & request risk score

```http
POST /api/v1/risk
Content-Type: application/fhir+json

{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "123",
  "gender": "male",
  "birthDate": "1970-05-15"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Observation",
  "id": "framingham-score-123",
  "valueQuantity": {
    "value": 12.3,
    "unit": "%"
  }
}
```

### Example: ECG analysis

You may send raw ECG data or a FHIR-compatible Observations bundle to an ECG microservice, which returns anomalies or flags AF episodes.
